# CSS transfrom in depth.

At first glance CSS transform property is pretty easy since it works in a very declarative
way. If you tell the browser to rotate an element around Z axis by `45deg`, or scale an element `2` times, or move it along Y axis by `100px` - it will do it easily!

<Example1 client:only />

Anyway, the more you work with complex CSS animations the more you understand that there are actually some interesting things about CSS transform logic under the hood.

In the article i always try to avoid typical matematician explanation since i find them unnecessary difficult.

---

## How transform functions work

When you apply a transform property to an element the browser creates 3 dimensional space with 3 axes.
See the following picture to understand the model and default axises directions.

( Z AXIS LOOKS AT YOU, Y AXIS LOOKS DOWN )
An image with transform translate 0 and axis;

There are some transform functions available:

1. `translateX`, `translateZ`, `translateY`, `translate3d` - move an element along an axis
2. `rotate`, `rotate3d`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `rotateZ` - rotate an element along an axis
3. `skew`, `skewX`, `skewY` - distort the element by specific axis
4. `scale`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` - scale by specific axis

> Every transform function is applied to transform-axes, _not the element_. Axes are placed relatevely the element accordingly to `transform-origin` value.

In other words, CSS transform functions based on transform matrix R4. Every function represents a specific matrix that will be multipled by another function-matrix in order, from left to right. But i want you to use my explanation since it is more clear than matrices IMHO.

I know that this concept may be a little bit tricky, but the next example is supposed to clarify everything.

The task: rotate the element by `45deg` with the pivot point at the center and move it along X axis by `25px`;

<Example4 client:only />

As you can see the element is not moving by actual X axis - the translate path is rotated with the element!

---

Another example.

> The task: move the cube by `25px` and scale it `2` times.

```css
.box {
  transform-origin: center;
  transform: translateX(25px) scale(2);
}
```

<Example2 mode="translate-scale" client:only />

But what if we change the order of transfrom functions?
Stop and think a little about it.
Look at the code below - everthing should work as an example above - scale the cube 2 times and translate it by `25px`.

```css
.box {
  transform-origin: center;
  transform: scale(2) translateX(25px);
}
```

<Example2 mode="scale-translate" client:only />

Astonishing result: the cube is moved by `50px`! Why is that?
Because we do not scale the object, we scale axes!
Before scaling axes pixel was exactly like viewport pixel, but after scaling it became 2 times bigger.

---

Again: we do not work with the element, we work with it's transform-axes.

## Transform related properties

### Transform origin

We are able to define where our axes are gonna be placed relatevely to an element using `transform-origin` value.

To see how it affects the result of tranforms lets use rotateZ function with different transform-origin value;

<Example3 client:only />

---

### Perspective

This is a very powerful feature that allows you to move your model to fell 3d space. That property defines how far the user is located from your model.

```css
.container {
  perspective: 300px;
}
.box {
  transform: rotateY(50deg);
}
```

<Perspective1 client:only />

### Transform style

| Value       | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| flat        | default value;                                    |
| preserve-3d | creates 3 dimensional axes for direct child nodes |

### Perspective origin

The property defines point of view on our container with perspective property defined. MDN has amazing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective-origin" target="_blank">demo</a> where you can fully understand the property. Anyway i don't find the property really useful since i have never used it.

## Transform functions

I am not gonna make a review of all transform function since the Interned is full of such information. Let's pay some attention to bad-known functions.

### Skew

This is quite hard to understand this function without knowlendge from above, but we are ready.
If you do skewY(45deg), it rotates x axis by 45deg. Simple as that! Points coordinates were not changed, we just changed the base axes.

See the example to understand what is happening to axes when we apply skew function.

<SkewExample client:only />

### Matrix3d

I think you have never heard, never used and will never use the function since it is constructed for mathematitian goys.

```css
.box {
  transform: matrix3d(
    1, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 1, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 1, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1
  )
}
```

This is something called 4x4 transformation matrix ( or homogeneous matrix ). But there is one cool thing about it - you are able to apply many transform functions in a really short way.
[Here](https://code-industry.ru/masterpdfeditor-help/transformation-matrix/) you can find a really cool explanation of what is homogeneous matrix
But i suggest you just to play with some inputs on [this amazing website](https://ramlmn.github.io/visualizing-matrix3d/) with live demo.

### Rotate3d

I know, this is not a property, but this is a functuion that requires special attention.
It allows you to define a vector around which the element will rotate. The vector starts from the transfrom-origin.

```css
.box {
  /* transform: rotate(x, y, z, angle); */
  transform: rotate3d(1, 1, 0, 45deg);
}
```

The feature can be actually useful for some cases.
For example - interactive plane that looks at the user's cursor.

<SpectateCursor1 client:only />

```js
const pythagorean = (x, y) => Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x, 2) + Math.pow(y, 2));

container.addEventListener('mousemove', (e: MouseEvent) => {
  const {
    width,
    height,
    x: xOffset,
    top: yOffset,
  } = container.getBoundingClientRect();

  const x = e.clientX - xOffset - width / 2;
  const y = e.clientY - yOffset - height / 2;

  const angle = (pythagorean(x, y) / pythagorean(height / 2, width / 2)) * 60;

  box.style.transform = `rotate3d(${-y}, ${x}, 0, ${angle}deg)`;
  shadow.style.transform = `rotate3d(${Math.abs(y)}, ${x}, 0, ${angle}deg)`;
});
```

If your really liked the demo you can read the explanation. But be aware, explanation is 2 times harnder than the whole article :)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

##### Normalize coordinate system

First of all, i wanna get normal coordinate system, specifically i wanna move the origin of coordinate system to the center of my container. Expected result - when i move my cursor to the center, the point is (0,0), left top corner of the box is ( - width / 2, - height / 2) point.

<SpectateCursor2 client:only />

##### Find rotation vector

That is good. Now i wanna get the rotation vector. The point that we got on the previous step is not the needed rotation vector. Rotation vector has to be a perpendicular to the user's cursor vector.

[IMAGE]

I have found the vector using a math trick ( no math PHD is needed ). This formula is necessary and sufficient condition for 2 vectors to be perpendicular:

```
Ax * Bx + Ay * By = 0;
```

This is an amazing equation since we can simply consider A coords as B coords, with small changes. Bx = -Ay, By = Ax.

```
Ax * -Ay + Ax * Ay = 0;
Ax * Ay = Ax * Ay;
```

<details>
<summary>Another trick to find a perpendicular vector using the system</summary>

```
sqrt(x^2+y^2)=sqrt(12500)
sqrt((-50 - x)^2 + (-100 - y)^2)=sqrt(12500 + 12500)

// where -50 = currentX, -100 = currentY
// sqrt(12500) = sqrt(-50*-50 + -100*-100)
```

The system comes from the fact that the length of needed vector equals length of current vector and the distance between these two points can be calulated vie Pyphagor theorem.

</details>

So our rotation vector is `(-y, x)`. We could use `(y, -x)` but there are some limitations. Such vector will lead to rotation the element to the opposide side, direction of vector defines which direction element is gonna rotate around.

```js
box.style.transform = `rotate3d(${-y}, ${x}, 0, 60deg)`;
```

In the line above i made the rotation angle fixed for simplifying understanding process.
Now we are ready to make it alive.

##### Making rotation alive

This angle as you can see depends on how far users cursor is located from the element ( from the center of container ). How to calculate the length from one point to another point in the decarts coordinate system? Pythagoras theorem, junior school.

```
Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x, 2) + Math.pow(y, 2))
```

Now my idea is somehow use the value for rotation, but now the number can be pretty large because container can be big. E.g. 300deg is not good for us.
I want the rotation to be in the next range: `[0, 60]`. So i need to limit the result of my calculations with the 60 value. I need to make a projection.

`x` - current value, `MaxX` - maximum x value, `ProjectionBase`- the value we wanna limit the current value with.

```
Projection = x / MaxX * ProjectionBase
```

`x / MaxX` returns a value from 0 to 1, and then just multiply it by ProjectionBase. So if `x = MaxX` then `Projection` will be `ProjectionBase`. That is what we need.

```js
function pythagorean(sideA, sideB) {
  return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(sideA, 2) + Math.pow(sideB, 2));
}

const angle = (pythagorean(x, y) / pythagorean(height / 2, width / 2)) * 60;
shadow.style.transform = `rotate3d(${Math.abs(y)}, ${x}, 0, ${angle}deg)`;
```

</details>

## Small tips

### Translate rotated element by real axis

> The task: move rotated element by by horizontal axis.

As you remember, if we try to do something like that:

```css
.box {
  transform: rotate(60deg) translateX(50px);
}
```

then our element is gonna be translated by rotated x axis. That does not fit the purpose.

We have to use some simple trigonometry. It is incredebly useful to know how to use trigonometry circle, because css and js provides you several helpful functions like `sin` and `cos`.
So, lets rotate the element. Its axes are rotated as well, but we have to translate the element around previous axes. Fortunately, we know how our axes were changed - they were just rotaed by 60 degrees! What does that mean?

> It means that every point in the current coordinate system was rotated as well. Here is the formula.

```js
const newX = Math.cos(ROTATION_ANGLE) * prevX;
const newY = Math.sin(ROTATION_ANGE) * prevY;
```

So before rotation we had a point (100, 0). That would be our translation before rotation to reach needed effect.
Let's rotate the point using our formula.

```js
const x = Math.ceil(Math.cos(ROTATION_RAD) * TRANSLATION);
const y = Math.ceil(-Math.sin(ROTATION_RAD) * TRANSLATION);
```

Keep in mind that i turned sin value into negative one because CSS Y coordinate is opposite to common Descartes one.

See the result!

### Implicit positioned ancestor

If you apply any transfrom function to an element, the element becomes a positioned ancestor, so any nested element with position absolute is gonna be positioned relatevely our transformed element!

### Svg transform

Every svg non-meta element like rect or path can be animatied. Never forget about it!

### Safari issues

If you face any flickering issues with animated elements in Safari browser just try to use the next properties on the flickering element / container.

```css
.safari-flickering-element {
  -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
  /* OR */
  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
  /* OR */
  -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
}
```

## Conclusion

I hope that you learned something useful from the article. If not - you are already very powerful developer! Unfortunately, a very small percentage of developers know HOW something actually works.

God bless you
